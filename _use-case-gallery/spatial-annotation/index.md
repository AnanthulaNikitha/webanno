The project develops an annotation scheme for *spatial entities* in literature and their 
classification into the narratological categories of plot-relevant *settings* or *mentioned 
spaces*. For this, also dependent entities like characters and their coreferences as well as 
direct speech are considered. A similar annotation has been done in the 
[DROC corpus](https://gitlab2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/kallimachos/DROC-Release), which was 
imported into WebAnno in UIMA CAS XMI format as data set for the project.

The annotation of spaces captures spatial entities within a WebAnno layer, to which a tagset is
attached for the classification of plot-relevance. Moreover, a relation layer serves for
annotation of coreferences between spatial entities.
