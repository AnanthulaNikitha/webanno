SameSame is a dataset of potential paraphrases annotated on three granularity levels, namely the 
sentence level, the event level, and the event element level in order to analyse the 
compositionality of paraphrases. Here, events were defined as predicate-argument structures.

It is based on 41 sentence pairs from the Microsoft Paraphrase Corpus (MSPC) (Dolan and Brockett,
2005) and 47 tweet pairs from the Twitter Paraphrase Corpus (TPC) (Xu et al., 2014) .
The dataset consists of 88 sentence pairs with 161 event pairs. Between each pair, a relation is
annotated, indicating whether there is a paraphrase.

It was annotated by two annotators with WebAnno using custom span and relation layers. Both 
annotation are present in the final dataset.
