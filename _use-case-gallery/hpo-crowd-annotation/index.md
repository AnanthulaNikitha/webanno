This [project]( https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/HPO_Crowd_Annotation_Experiment) consisted in
comparing crowd annotations with automatic annotation approaches. We organized two annotation 
sessions using WebAnno as the annotation platform, which we installed in our server. On the first
annotation session, we used the Human Phenotype corpus, annotation with concepts from the human
phenotype ontology, and evaluated a crowd approach with the gold standard. On the second occasion,
we annotated radiology terms on clinical reports, and compared with pattern-based and machine
learning approaches. 

We choose WebAnno since it was versatile enough for our needs, easy to install and set-up in our
server, and free of charge.
