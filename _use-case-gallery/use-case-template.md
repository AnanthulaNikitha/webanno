If you have used WebAnno for an annotation project, we would love to include it in the WebAnno
use-case gallery. This gives your work a spotlight and helps us demonstrating the versatility 
of WebAnno.

Below is a short template with information that should be included in a use-case submission. Please
also have a look at other use-cases in the gallery if you would like to get some inspiration for how
to best present your work. 

* **Title**
* **Description**
  * short description of the data set and annotation task
  * optionally any key features of WebAnno that were essential for the task (and which set WebAnno apart from other tools that were considered)
  * optionally short description of how data was imported to and exported from WebAnno
* **Website URL(s)**
  * website describing the research project in which WebAnno was used
* **Publication URL(s)**
  * links to any publications from the project in which the use of WebAnno was described or mentioned
* **Data URL(s)**
  * where the annotated data an be downloaded
* **Screenshot(s)**
  * screenshot illustrating the annotated data, best from the annotation page
  * best provide one or more screenshots of the entire WebAnno browser window, I would cut out a suitable "thumbnail" area which would link to the full image when clicked on in the gallery
  
Please send the description by mail to: **richard.eckart AT gmail.com**

Thanks!
