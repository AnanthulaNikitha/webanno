SemRelData (Semantic Relation Dataset) is a dataset focused on contextual annotation of classical 
semantic relations between nominals in various genres, i.e. encyclopedic, literary and news 
texts, and different languages, here: English, German and Russian. 

It consists of texts extracted from three different genres – encyclopedic texts, extracted from 
Wikipedia; newspaper articles, extracted from Wikinews; and out-of-copyright literary texts. The
dataset is distributed under a CC-BY license.

The resulting dataset consists of 13 news articles, 20 encyclopedic articles, and snippets from 
9 literary texts, all available in parallel in the three described languages, and contains 
approximately 60,000 tokens, 15,000 noun compounds, 3,400 annotated relations and 9,400 
transitive relations.

The dataset was created by a team of annotators in WebAnno using custom relation and span layers.
The annotations were then compared and merged into a final annotation set using the curation
functionalities.
