This project constructed a dataset for named entity recognition in Brazilian Legal Text composed of 
legislation and legal decision texts. As named entity categories we have Person, Organization, Time,
Location, Legislation and Legal Decisions. The data was imported to and exported from WebAnno using the 
CoNLL-2002 format.
