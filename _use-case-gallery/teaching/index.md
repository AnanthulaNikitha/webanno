In the class <i>Computational Linguistic methods for Digital Humanities</i>, WebAnno is being 
used to introduce students of the DH Master's program to annotation concepts. Students are 
annotating in groups, following the full annotation workflow: 

* preparing documents,
* setting up an annotation project, 
* distributing tasks to fellow students, 
* analyzing annotation disagreements and
* making final decisions. 

As tasks, we use both part of speech tagging and coreference resolution.
