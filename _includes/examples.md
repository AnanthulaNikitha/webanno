### Examples

Download the following examples. Ensure that your browser is **not** configured to automatically 
extract ZIP files. Then import the ZIP files from the **Project management** page in WebAnno.

* [Chunking example project]({{ site.url }}/examples/demo-chunk.zip)
* [Coreference example project]({{ site.url }}/examples/demo-coref.zip)
* [Correction mode example project]({{ site.url }}/examples/demo-corr.zip)
* [German example project (POS + dependencies)]({{ site.url }}/examples/demo-de.zip)
* [English example project (POS + dependencies)]({{ site.url }}/examples/demo-en.zip)
* [Unicode example project]({{ site.url }}/examples/demo-unicode.zip)

**NOTE**: The example projects are known to contain data inconsistencies. You may experience
problems or strange effects e.g. when exporting files from these projects into different formats.
We are looking into this [issue](https://github.com/webanno/webanno/issues/452). However, you can
still use them to get an idea of how WebAnno works and to play around a bit.
