    title: A Flexible, Web-based and Visually Supported System for Distributed Annotations
    text: WebAnno is a general purpose web-based annotation tool for a wide range of linguistic annotations including various layers of morphological, syntactical, and semantic annotations.Additionaly, custom annotation layers can be defined, allowing WebAnno to be used also for non-linguistic annotation tasks.
---

WebAnno is a multi-user tool supporting different roles such as annotator, curator, and project manager. The progress and quality of annotation projects can be monitored and measuered in terms of inter-annotator agreement. Multiple annotation projects can be conducted in parallel.

Different modes of annotation are supported, including a correction mode to review externally pre-annotated data, and an automation mode in which WebAnno learns and offers annotation suggestions.

WebAnno is a fully web-based tool with a lower entry barrier than other annotation tools. Annotators and annotation project managers do not require to download any software. A modern web-browser is sufficent. After installation on a web-server, all settings can be reached through the browser.
